#Sample Applications

These applications are simple examples that use RAJA as a portability layer.
The applications available are a one- and two-dimensional FFT, as well as matrix multiplication.
There is also an example that makes use of RAJA's dependent index set figures.

This program is built using CMake - simply make a build directory and run CMake (Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if` you aren't installing to /usr/local; we usualy set it to `tpl/`).
All applications can be compiled by running `make`.
Figures are generated by running `make figures` and can be found in the `figs` directory.
